The accumulator pattern
	the pattern of iterating the updating of a variable is commonly referred to as the accumulator pattern
	the variable is the accumulator
	must initialize variable before iteration starts

Functions can call other functions
	you can call functions from inside another function
	breaking a problem into smaller subproblems is called functional decomposition
	generalization is a cs problem solving technique
	need to look for patterns in code
	functions can simplify a program by hiding a complex computation behind a single command. this is abstraction
	creating a new function can make the program smaller

Flow of execution summary
	flow of execution is the order in which statements are executed
	execution goes top to bottom, and functions don't run until they're called
	at end of program, it terminates
