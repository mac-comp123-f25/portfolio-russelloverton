Chapter 8 revisits iteration more deeply
you get more with for loops (revisited) and with while loops
you can do more interesting things like random walks, the 3n+1 sequence, and Newton’s method
you see the accumulator pattern again in new contexts
you learn use of sentinel values and validating input in loops
the chapter also discusses building simple tables and 2D nested iteration (for example image processing)
you see algorithms you already know in new light
you might see something like for i in range(n): … used inside loops over rows and columns
iteration becomes a very powerful tool when combined with nested loops and smart stopping conditions
